	  U-Boot expects to be linked to a specific hard-coded address, and to
	  be loaded to and run from that address. This option lifts that
	  restriction, thus allowing the code to be loaded to and executed from
	  almost any 4K aligned address. This logic relies on the relocation
	  information that is embedded in the binary to support U-Boot
	  relocating itself to the top-of-RAM later during execution.
