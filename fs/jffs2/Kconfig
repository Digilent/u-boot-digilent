config FS_JFFS2
	bool "Enable JFFS2 filesystem support"
	help
	  This provides support for reading images from JFFS2 (Journalling
	  Flash File System version 2). JFFS2 is a log-structured file system
	  for use with flash memory devices. It supports raw NAND devices,
	  hard links and compression.

config JFFS2_LZO
	bool "Enable LZO compression in JFFS2"
	depends on FS_JFFS2
	help
	  Enable LZO compression in the JFFS2 filesystem

config JFFS2_NAND
	bool "Enable JFFS2 support for NAND flash"
	depends on FS_JFFS2
	help
	  Enable support for NAND flash as the backing store for JFFS2.

config SYS_JFFS2_SORT_FRAGMENTS
	bool "Enable JFFS2 sorting of filesystem fragments (SLOW!)"
	depends on FS_JFFS2
	help
	  If you boot from a partition which is mounted writable, and you
	  update your boot environment by replacing single files on that
	  partition, you should also define CONFIG_SYS_JFFS2_SORT_FRAGMENTS.
	  Scanning the JFFS2 filesystem takes *much* longer with this feature,
	  though.  Sorting is done while inserting into the fragment list,
	  which is more or less a bubble sort. That algorithm is known to be
	  O(n^2), thus you should really consider if you can avoid it!
