	  This provides support for reading images from EROFS filesystem.
	  EROFS (Enhanced Read-Only File System) is a lightweight read-only
	  file system for scenarios which need high-performance read-only
	  requirements.

	  It also provides fixed-sized output compression support, which
	  improves storage density, keeps relatively higher compression
	  ratios, which is more useful to achieve high performance for
	  embedded devices with limited memory.

config FS_EROFS_ZIP
	bool "EROFS Data Compression Support"
	depends on FS_EROFS
	select LZ4
	default y
	help
	  Enable fixed-sized output compression for EROFS.
	  If you don't want to enable compression feature, say N.
