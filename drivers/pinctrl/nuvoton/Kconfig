	  Support pin muxing and pin configuration on
	  Nuvoton NPCM8XX SoC.

	  The NPCM8XX contains 256 GPIO pins. Most of them are
	  multiplexed with other system functions. These pins can
	  be configured as either GPIO pin or alternate function.
	  It also supports basic configurations such as pull up/down,
	  drive-strength, and slew rate control for some of the pins.
