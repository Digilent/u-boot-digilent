config ASPEED_HACE
	bool "ASPEED Hash and Crypto Engine"
	depends on DM_HASH
	help
	  Select this option to enable a driver for using the SHA engine in
	  the ASPEED BMC SoCs.

	  Enabling this allows the use of SHA operations in hardware without
	  requiring the SHA software implementations. It also improves performance
	  and saves code size.

config ASPEED_ACRY
	bool "ASPEED RSA and ECC Engine"
	depends on ASPEED_AST2600
	help
	 Select this option to enable a driver for using the RSA/ECC engine in
	 the ASPEED BMC SoCs.

	 Enabling this allows the use of RSA/ECC operations in hardware without requiring the
