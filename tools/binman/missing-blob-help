# This file contains help messages for missing external blobs. Each message has
# a tag (MUST be just lower-case text, digits and hyphens) starting in column 1,
# followed by a colon (:) to indicate its start. The message can include any
# number of lines, including blank lines.
#
# When looking for a tag, Binman uses the value of 'missing-msg' for the entry,
# the entry name or the entry type, in that order

atf-bl31:
See the documentation for your board. You may need to build ARM Trusted
Firmware and build with BL31=/path/to/bl31.bin

atf-bl31-sunxi:
Please read the section on ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF) in
board/sunxi/README.sunxi64

scp-sunxi:
SCP firmware is required for system suspend, but is otherwise optional.
Please read the section on SCP firmware in board/sunxi/README.sunxi64

iot2050-seboot:
See the documentation for IOT2050 board. Your image is missing SEBoot
which is mandatory for board startup. Prebuilt SEBoot located at
meta-iot2050/tree/master/recipes-bsp/u-boot/files/prebuild/seboot_pg*.bin.

iot2050-otpcmd:
See the documentation for IOT2050 board. Your image is missing OTP command data
block which is used for provisioning the customer keys to the board.
Please refer to
meta-iot2050/tree/master/recipes-bsp/secure-boot-otp-provisioning/files/make-otpcmd.sh
for how to generate this binary. If you are not using secure boot or do not
intend to provision the keys, disable CONFIG_IOT2050_EMBED_OTPCMD.

k3-rti-wdt-firmware:
If CONFIG_WDT_K3_RTI_LOAD_FW is enabled, a firmware image is needed for
the R5F core(s) to trigger the system reset. One possible source is
https://github.com/siemens/k3-rti-wdt.

rockchip-tpl:
An external TPL is required to initialize DRAM. Get the external TPL
binary and build with ROCKCHIP_TPL=/path/to/ddr.bin. One possible source
for the external TPL binary is https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkbin.

tee-os:
See the documentation for your board. You may need to build Open Portable
Trusted Execution Environment (OP-TEE) and build with TEE=/path/to/tee.bin

opensbi:
See the documentation for your board. The OpenSBI git repo is at
https://github.com/riscv/opensbi.git
You may need to build fw_dynamic.bin first and re-build u-boot with
OPENSBI=/path/to/fw_dynamic.bin
