	  This enables the ECDSA (elliptic curve signature) algorithm for FIT
	  image verification in U-Boot. The ECDSA algorithm is implemented
	  using the driver model, so CONFIG_DM is required by this library.
	  See doc/uImage.FIT/signature.txt for more details.
	  ECDSA is enabled for mkimage regardless of this option.

	  Allow ECDSA signatures to be recognized and verified in U-Boot.

config SPL_ECDSA_VERIFY
	bool "Enable ECDSA verification support in SPL"
	depends on SPL
	help
	  Allow ECDSA signatures to be recognized and verified in SPL.
