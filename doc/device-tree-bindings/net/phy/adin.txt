* Analog Devices ADIN PHY Device Tree binding

Required properties:
- reg: PHY address

Optional properties:
- adi,rx-internal-delay-ps: RGMII RX Clock Delay used only when PHY operates
	in RGMII mode with internal delay (phy-mode is 'rgmii-id' or
	'rgmii-rxid') in pico-seconds.
- adi,tx-internal-delay-ps: RGMII TX Clock Delay used only when PHY operates
	in RGMII mode with internal delay (phy-mode is 'rgmii-id' or
	'rgmii-txid') in pico-seconds.
- adi,phy-mode-override: Override phy-mode property for adin. This is useful
	when a single device tree supports an adin PHY (e.g. ADIN1300)
	or another PHY (e.g. AR8033) at the same address, but they require
	different phy-modes.

Example:

	ethernet-phy@0 {
		reg = <0>;

		adi,rx-internal-delay-ps = <1800>;
		adi,tx-internal-delay-ps = <2200>;
		adi,phy-mode-override = "rgmii-id";
	};
