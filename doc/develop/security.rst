Handling of security vulnerabilities
====================================

The U-Boot project takes security very seriously.  As such, we'd like to know
when a security bug is found so that it can be fixed and disclosed as quickly
as possible.

Contact
-------

The preferred initial point of contact is to send email to
`u-boot@lists.denx.de` and use `scripts/get_maintainers.pl` to also include any
relevant custodians. In addition, Tom Rini should be contacted at
`trini@konsulko.com`.

CVE assignment
--------------

The U-Boot project cannot directly assign CVEs, nor do we require them for
reports or fixes, as this can needlessly complicate the process and may delay
the bug handling. If a reporter wishes to have a CVE identifier assigned ahead
of public disclosure, they will need to coordinate this on their own.  When
such a CVE identifier is known before a patch is provided, it is desirable to
mention it in the commit message if the reporter agrees.

Non-disclosure agreements
-------------------------

The U-Boot project is not a formal body and therefore unable to enter any
non-disclosure agreements.
